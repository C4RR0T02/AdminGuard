CHECK CONTENT TO BE MANUALLY CHECKED

V-254244 - Windows Server 2022 shared user accounts must not be permitted.
Determine whether any shared accounts exist. If no shared accounts exist, this is NA.

Shared accounts, such as required by an application, may be approved by the organization. This must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO). Documentation must include the reason for the account, who has access to the account, and how the risk of using the shared account is mitigated to include monitoring account activity.

If unapproved shared accounts exist, this is a finding.
